# Changing the line spacing of a text file
Write a script that reads each line of a target file, then writes the line back to stdout, but with an extra blank line following. This has the effect of double-spacing the file.

Include all necessary code to check whether the script gets the necessary command-line argument (a filename), and whether the specified file exists.

When the script runs correctly, modify it to triple-space the target file.

Finally, write a script to remove all blank lines from the target file, single-spacing it.
